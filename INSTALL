Installation Instructions
*************************

Here is how to perform a minimal installation with default options.

First run the configure script:

./configure

If you want to be able to run tlsprobe in server mode and listen on privileged ports (ports < 1024), you should either install tlsprobe with setuid or, if you use setcap, setcap cap_net_bind_service.
You can do so by typing:

./configure --enable-setuid-install

or (as root, in order to be able to see setcap):

./configure --enable-setcap-install

Then, to build the program, type:

make

finally, to install the program, type (as root):

make install

After installing, if you don't like the program, you can type (as root):

make uninstall

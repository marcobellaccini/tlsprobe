tlsprobe by Marco Bellaccini - marco.bellaccini[at!]gmail.com

tlsprobe is a simple program that tests a server for TLS Cipher Suites support (client mode) or, listening for TLS connections, discovers Cipher Suites offered by a client (server mode).
In client mode, it just sends TLS ClientHello messages, and, by looking at server's reply (if any), determines whether the selected Cipher Suite(s) is supported or not.
tlsprobe builds TLS messages in a "byte-by-byte" fashion and so does not need any tls library (that's it: no OpenSSL, no GnuTLS, no libNSS).
The program supports both single Cipher Suite support check and a full-scan mode (in which it checks for support of all the known cipher suites in the IANA list).

Here follows some usage examples.

List all Cipher Suites supported by www.google.com (https, tcp port 443):
tlsprobe -F www.google.com

Tests if www.google.com (https, tcp port 443) supports cipher suite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA:
tlsprobe -c TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA www.google.com

List all Cipher Suites supported by Active Directory Domain Controller 10.0.0.5 with LDAP over ssl/tls (ldaps, tcp port 636):
tlsprobe -F -p 636 10.0.0.5

Listen for TLS connections on TCP port 443 and print Cipher Suites offered by the client:
tlsprobe -S 0.0.0.0

Listen for TLS connections on TCP port 8443 and print Cipher Suites offered by the client:
tlsprobe -S -p 8443 0.0.0.0

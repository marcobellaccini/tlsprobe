tlsprobe - a TLS testing utility (by Marco Bellaccini - marco.bellaccini[at!]gmail.com)

tlsprobe is a simple program that tests a server for TLS Cipher Suites support (client mode) or, listening for incoming TLS connections, discovers Cipher Suites offered by a client (server mode).
tlsprobe is Free Software, released under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

In client mode, tlsprobe just sends TLS ClientHello messages, and, by looking at server's reply (if any), determines whether the selected Cipher Suite(s) is supported or not.
tlsprobe builds TLS messages in a "byte-by-byte" fashion and so does not need any TLS library (i.e.: no OpenSSL, no GnuTLS, no libNSS).
The program supports both single Cipher Suite support check and a full-scan mode (in which it checks for support of all the cipher suites listed in the IANA TLS Cipher Suite Registry - http://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-4 ).
In server mode, it waits for a ClientHello to arrive and parse it, discovering offered Cipher Suites.

tlsprobe provides you with a visual feedback of the security level of the various TLS Cipher Suites, based on Mozilla Server-Side-TLS Recommendations: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS .
It highlights the discovered Cipher Suites with different colors, depending on the estimated security level.

Working at TLS level, tlsprobe is generic and also supports probing non-https services (you just have to specify the right port for the higher-level protocol with the -p option).

Here follows some usage examples.

>>Client mode

List all Cipher Suites supported by www.google.com (https, tcp port 443):

tlsprobe -F www.google.com

Tests if www.google.com (https, tcp port 443) supports cipher suite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA:

tlsprobe -c TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA www.google.com

List all Cipher Suites supported by Active Directory Domain Controller 10.0.0.5 with LDAP over ssl/tls (ldaps, tcp port 636):

tlsprobe -F -p 636 10.0.0.5

>>Server mode

Listen for TLS connections on TCP port 443 and print Cipher Suites offered by the client:

tlsprobe -S 0.0.0.0

Listen for TLS connections on TCP port 8443 and print Cipher Suites offered by the client:

tlsprobe -S -p 8443 0.0.0.0

tlsprobe - a TLS/SSL testing utility (by Marco Bellaccini - marco.bellaccini[at!]gmail.com)

tlsprobe is a simple program that tests a server for TLS/SSL Cipher Suites support (client mode) or, listening for incoming TLS/SSL connections, discovers Cipher Suites offered by a client (server mode).
tlsprobe is Free Software, released under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

In client mode, tlsprobe just sends ClientHello messages, and, by looking at server's reply (if any), determines whether the selected Cipher Suite(s) is supported or not.
tlsprobe builds TLS/SSL messages in a "byte-by-byte" fashion and so does not need any external library (i.e.: no OpenSSL, no GnuTLS, no libNSS).
The program supports both single Cipher Suite support check and a full-scan mode (in which it checks for support of all the cipher suites listed in the IANA TLS Cipher Suite Registry - http://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-4 ).
In server mode, it waits for a ClientHello to arrive and parse it, discovering offered Cipher Suites.

tlsprobe provides you with a visual feedback of the security/compatibility level of the various TLS/SSL Cipher Suites, based on Mozilla Server-Side-TLS Recommendations: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS .
It highlights the discovered Cipher Suites with different colors, depending on the estimated security and compatibility level.

Working at TLS/SSL level, tlsprobe is generic and also supports probing non-https services (you just have to specify the right port for the higher-level protocol with the -p option).

tlsprobe supports SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2.

Here follows some usage examples.

>>Client mode

List all Cipher Suites supported by www.google.com through TLS and SSL protocols (https, tcp port 443):

tlsprobe -F www.google.com

List all TLS Cipher Suites (i.e.: skip SSL3 scanning phase) supported by www.google.com (https, tcp port 443):

tlsprobe -j -F www.google.com

Tests if www.google.com (https, tcp port 443) supports cipher suite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA:

tlsprobe -c TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA www.google.com

Tests if www.google.com (https, tcp port 443) supports cipher suite SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (with SSL 3.0 protocol):

tlsprobe -c SSL_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA www.google.com

List all Cipher Suites supported by Active Directory Domain Controller 10.0.0.5 with LDAP over ssl/tls (ldaps, tcp port 636):

tlsprobe -F -p 636 10.0.0.5

>>Server mode

Listen for TLS connections on TCP port 443 and print Cipher Suites offered by the client:

tlsprobe -S 0.0.0.0

Listen for TLS connections on TCP port 8443 and print Cipher Suites offered by the client:

tlsprobe -S -p 8443 0.0.0.0
